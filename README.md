# Inventory Management in C#
This is the first part of my future Point of Sales System that I'm currently developing in C#.

On the database side, I'm using SQLite, as it's very lightweight and just perfect for offline development.

Additional functions will be added whenever I find the time.

Next up will be the Checkout part of the PoS system!
